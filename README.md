Backend has to be set up first! Otherwise the frontend won't build as it's server-side-rendered.

## Backend

[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as the backend. Will add that to this repository as well soon.

## Frontend

Made by Next.js written in TypeScript. Utilizes static site generation (SSG) and incremental static regeneration (ISR).

**Read frontend's [README.md](frontend/README.md).**

## NGINX

NGINX configs I'm using can be found in [nginx](nginx).

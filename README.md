# Shingetsu Blog

Shingetsu (新月) is Japanese for new moon. Production: [luukuton.fi](https://luukuton.fi)

A backend has to be set up first. Otherwise the frontend won't build as the site utilizes static site generation (server side).

## Backend

[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as the backend. Will add that to this repository as well soon.

## Frontend

Made by Next.js written in TypeScript. Utilizes static site generation (SSG) and incremental static regeneration (ISR).

**Read frontend's [README.md](frontend/README.md).**

## NGINX

NGINX configs I'm using can be found in [nginx](nginx).
